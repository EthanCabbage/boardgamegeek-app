# bgg-app
A cross-platform (Windows/OS X/Linux) desktop application for [boardgamegeek.com](http://www.boardgamegeek.com) created with Electron (official name forthcoming).

## Quick Start
Make sure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) are installed on your system.
In a terminal, navigate to the bgg-app directory and enter the following comand:

```
npm start
```

If you get an error message from npm, check to make sure your node.js and npm versions are [up-to-date](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). I had to restart my shell after updating npm before it would work with bgg-app.
You can check which versions you are running with these commands:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

During development, I used node v6.9.2 and npm 4.0.5.
